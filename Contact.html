    <h2>What information stored in contact?</h2>
    <p>
        Google Contacts has become an increasingly popular product for staying organized. 
        It allows users to store and manage their contacts across multiple devices, 
        providing a better way of organizing contact information. 
        Not only is Google Contacts easy to use and highly secure, 
        but it also helps you save time you would have spent on 
        manually entering data into your address book.
