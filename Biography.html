    <h2>What is Biography?</h2>
    <p>
        A biography is simply the story of a real person’s life. It could be about a person who is still alive, 
        someone who lived centuries ago, someone who is globally famous, an unsung hero forgotten by history, 
        or even a unique group of people. The facts of their life, from birth to death (or the present day of the author), 
        are included with life-changing moments often taking center stage. 
        The author usually points to the subject’s childhood, coming-of-age events, 
        relationships, failures, and successes in order to create a well-rounded description of her subject.
